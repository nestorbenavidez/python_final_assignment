Example:
You have to add your answer within the functions. This is slightly different to what 
we did in class and similar to the Jupyter Notebook exercises we had at the start. You
can see an example below:

    Q0: Compute the sum of two integers.

The template for this question looks like that:

    def q0(num_1, num_2):
        # Your code follows below: replace `None` with your code
        sum_of_the_two = None
        
        # Do not change the code below
        return sum_of_the_two 

The code below shows my attempt in solving the question:
"""

def q0(num_1, num_2):
    # Your code follows below: replace `None` with your code
    sum_of_the_two = num_1 + num_2

    # Do not change the code below
    return sum_of_the_two
